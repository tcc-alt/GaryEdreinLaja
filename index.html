                <h2>Best of the Philippines</h2>
                <h3>Unveiling the Philippines' Rich Culture, Beauty and Awareness</h3>
                <p>The Philippines, an archipelago of stunning beauty and cultural richness, offers a myriad of experiences that captivate the hearts of those who explore its diverse islands. From the pristine beaches of Palawan to the lush terraces of Banaue, the natural landscapes are nothing short of breathtaking. The warmth and hospitality of the Filipino people, known for their genuine friendliness and the concept of "kapwa" or shared humanity, create an environment that feels like a home away from home. The country's cultural diversity, shaped by centuries of history and a blend of indigenous, Spanish, and American influences, is evident in its traditions, languages, and vibrant festivals. While the delicious cuisine, with iconic dishes like adobo and sinigang, is a culinary delight, it's important to move beyond misconceptions.</p>
                <p>The Philippines is not defined by poverty alone; it is a nation with a growing middle class and urban centers that boast modern amenities. Additionally, not every Filipino works overseas, and the country is not uniformly unsafe. While challenges exist, resilience is a defining trait of the Filipino spirit. By understanding and appreciating the complexities of this nation, one can truly embrace the best that the Philippines has to offer and dispel misconceptions that may overshadow its true essence.</p>

                          <p>
One of the biggest problems in the Philippines nowadays is that the cleanliness and overcrowded people especially on the capital city of the country which is the "Manila". Many foreign people often go or arrive directly in Manila because that is where the airport is located, and of course the first thing they notice is how many the population is in that area. According to Philippine Statistic Authority that the City of Manila reached a total population of 1,846,513 wherein 99.5 percent are household population and 0.5 percent are institutional population.
                          </p>
                          
                          <p>
It just means that there are really too many people living there, because other Filipinos thinking that the opportunity is greater in there. Another thing is the cost of living in Manila, it is higher compared to other places in the Philippines. Because of that, it is more chaotic and polluted and many poor people can be seen in this city. That is the first thing that foreigners who come to the Philippines criticize, misleading others that the country is not good and their first impression of the country does not match their expectations.

                          <h3>The People</h3>
                            <a class="left carousel-control" href="#carousel-example-generic" role="button" data-slide="prev">
                              <i class="fa fa-chevron-left" aria-hidden="true"></i>
                              <span class="sr-only">Previous</span>
                            </a>
                            <a class="right carousel-control" href="#carousel-example-generic" role="button" data-slide="next">
                              <i class="fa fa-chevron-right" aria-hidden="true"></i>
                              <span class="sr-only">Next</span>
                            </a>
                          <p>
 Another factor is the people, it cannot be denied that there are many exploitative people in the Philippines because of poverty, many foreigners are cheated especially the ignorant ones. They are called as scammers because of this, other victims of the scam are immediately informed to everyone that the Philippines is dangerous and not a good place to visit.
                          </p>
                          
                          <p>
But these events do not happen all over the country, there is misleading and spreading of wrong information to other foreigners and it leaves fear in other people who want to bet in the Philippines. There are still more beautiful things to be found in the Philippines, not only in the places but also in the people who live here. According to the Department of Tourism in the Philippines Back in 2012, the Philippine government started a campaign that branded the country as a perfect destination for beach bums and dive lovers. The slogan "It's More Fun in the Philippines" played a crucial role to educate people about how fun it would be to visit the country. So now let's find out what the country has to offer to the people that wants to visit Philippines.
